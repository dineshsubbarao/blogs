            <h1>Sharma’s international career kicked off with an ODI match against Ireland at Belfast in June 2007, when
                he took one catch but did not get a chance to bat or bowl. His T20I debut was later the same year, in
                the group game against England in the first T20I World Cup. Again, he didn’t get a chance to bat or bowl
                but took one catch, in a match remembered for Yuvraj Singh’s six sixes in an over. Sharma was Player of
                the Match in the quarterfinals against South Africa. He was also part of the team that won the T20I
                World Cup final, scoring a quick 30, the second highest score for India.

                Sharma scored his first ODI half-century in November 2007 and had a run of good scores in the 2007–08
                ODI series in Australia, which India won. He scored two ODI hundreds in 2010 but subsequently had a loss
                of form and fitness, which led to him being dropped from the eventually victorious 2011 ODI World Cup
                team. His loss of form continued for a couple of years, and he continued to be in and out of the team
